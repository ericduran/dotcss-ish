# dotCss-ish (sort of)

Simple system to manage small css changes around the internet.

I like the idea of dotCss (and dotJs) I just don't want to run
a server to serve css files.

This works with Chrome Default Styles sheets and a tiny extension.
You can read more about the extension over at (Ext)[ext]

1. Symlink your chrome Default styles directory to ~/.css
  * ```ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User\ StyleSheets ~/.css```
